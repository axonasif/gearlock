        Specify a different color set in the command line. The format of arg is documented in the ColorsColors section.

--configure-options
        Display configure options.

-d, --nomouse
        Disable mouse support.

-D N, --debuglevel=N
        Save the debug level for SMB VFS. N is in 0-10 range.

-e [file], --edit[=file]
        Start the internal editor. If the file is specified, open it on startup. See also mcedit (1).

-f, --datadir
        Display the compiled-in search paths for Midnight Commander files.

-F, --datadir-info
        Display extended info about compiled-in paths for Midnight Commander.

-g, --oldmouse
        Force a "normal tracking" mouse mode. Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (tmux/screen).

-k, --resetsoft
        Reset softkeys to their default from the termcap/terminfo database. Only useful on HP terminals when the function keys don't work.

-K file, --keymap=file
        Specify a name of keymap file in the command line.

-l file, --ftplog=file
        Save the ftpfs dialog with the server in file.

--nokeymap
        Don't load key bindings from any file, use default hardcoded keys.

-P file, --printwd=file
        Print the last working directory to the specified file. This option is not meant to be used directly. Instead, it's used from a special shell script that automatically changes the current directory of the shell to the last directory Midnight Commander was in. Source the file /gearlock/libexec/mc/mc.sh (bash and zsh users) or /gearlock/libexec/mc.csh (tcsh users) respectively to define mc as an alias to the appropriate shell script.

        Turn on the slow terminal mode, in this mode the program will not draw expensive line drawing characters and will toggle verbose mode off.

-S arg, --skin=arg
        Specify a name of skin in the command line. Technology of skins is documented in the SkinsSkins section.

-t, --termcap
        Used only if the code was compiled with S-Lang and terminfo: it makes Midnight Commander use the value of the TERMCAP variable for the terminal information instead of the information on the system wide terminal database

-u, --nosubshell
        Disable use of the concurrent shell (only makes sense if Midnight Commander has been built with concurrent shell support).

-U, --subshell
        Enable use of the concurrent shell support (only makes sense if the Midnight Commander was built with the subshell support set as an optional feature).

-v file, --view=file
        Start the internal viewer to view the specified file. See also mcview (1).

-V, --version
        Display the version of the program.

-x, --xterm
        Force xterm mode. Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).

-X, --no-x11
        Do not use X11 to get the state of modifiers Alt, Ctrl, Shift

If both paths are specified, the first path name is the directory to show in the active panel; the second path name is the directory to be shown in the other panel.

If one path is specified, the path name is the directory to show in the active panel; value of "other_dir" from panels.ini is the directory to be shown in the passive panel.

If no paths are specified, current directory is shown in the active panel; value of "other_dir" from panels.ini is the directory to be shown in the passive panel.[Overview]
Overview

The screen of Midnight Commander is divided into four parts. Almost all of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels. By default, the second line from the bottom of the screen is the shell command line, and the bottom line shows the function key labels. The topmost line is the menu bar lineMenu Bar. The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if you click the topmost line with the mouse or press the F9 key.

Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories at the same time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current panel. Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory of the unselected panel as a destination (don't worry, they always ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see the sections on the Directory PanelsDirectory Panels, the Left and Right MenusLeft and Right Menus and the File MenuFile Menu.

You can execute system commands from Midnight Commander by simply typing them. Everything you type will appear on the shell command line, and when you press Enter, Midnight Commander will execute the command line you typed; read the Shell Command LineShell Command Line and Input Line KeysInput Line Keys sections to learn more about the command line.[Mouse Support]
Mouse Support

Midnight Commander comes with mouse support. It is activated whenever you are running on an xterm(1) terminal (it even works if you take a telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm) or if you are running on a Linux console and have the gpm mouse server running.

When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is selected; if you click with the right button, the file is marked (or unmarked, depending on the previous state).

Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is an executable program; and if the extension fileEdit Extension File has a program specified for the file's extension, the specified program is executed.

Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function key labels by clicking on them.

The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by editing the ~/.config/mc/iniSave Setup file and changing the mouse_repeat_rate parameter.

If you are running Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding down the Shift key.

[Keys]
Keys

Some commands in Midnight Commander involve the use of the Control (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the Meta (sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this manual we will use the following abbreviations:

C-<chr> means hold the Control key while typing the character <chr>. Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.

Alt-<chr>
        means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing <chr>. If there is no Meta or Alt key, type ESC, release it, then type the character <chr>.

S-<chr> means hold the Shift key down while typing <chr>.

All input lines in Midnight Commander use an approximation to the GNU Emacs editor's key bindings (default).

You may redefine key bindings. See redefine hotkey bindingsKeys_redefine

for more info. All other key bindings (described in this manual) are relative to default behavior.

There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are the most important.

The File MenuFile Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in the File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most of these commands perform some action, usually on the selected file or the tagged files.

The Directory PanelsDirectory Panels section documents the keys which select a file or tag files as a target for a later action (the action is usually one from the file menu).

The Shell Command LineShell Command Line section list the keys which are used for entering and editing command lines. Most of these copy file names and such from the directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive typing) or access the command line history.

Input Line KeysInput Line Keys are used for editing input lines. This means both the command line and the input lines in the query dialogs.[Keys_redefine]
Redefine hotkey bindings

Hotkey bindings may be read from external file (keymap-file). Initially, Midnight Commander creates key bindings using keymap defined in the source code. Then, two files /gearlock/share/mc/mc.keymap and /gearlock/etc/mc/mc.keymap are loaded always, sequentially reassigned key bindings defined earlier. User-defined keymap-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):

        1) command line option -K <keymap> or --keymap=<keymap>
        2) Environment variable MC_KEYMAP
        3) Parameter keymap in section [Midnight-Commander] of config file.
        4) File ~/.config/mc/mc.keymap

Command line option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to the keymap-file (with the extension .keymap or without it). Search of keymap-file will occur in (to the first one found):

        1) ~/.config/mc
        2) /gearlock/etc/mc/
        3) /gearlock/share/mc/[Miscellaneous Keys]
Miscellaneous Keys

Here are some keys which don't fall into any of the other categories:

Enter   if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom of the panels), then that command is executed. If there is no text in the command line then if the selection bar is over a directory the Midnight Commander does a chdir(2) to the selected directory and reloads the information on the panel; if the selection is an executable file then it is executed. Finally, if the extension of the selected file name matches one of the extensions in the extensions fileEdit Extension File then the corresponding command is executed.

C-l     repaint all the information in Midnight Commander.

C-x c   run the ChmodChmod command on a file or on the tagged files.

C-x o   run the ChownChown command on the current file or on the tagged files.

C-x l   run the hard link command.

C-x s   run the absolute symbolic link command.

C-x v   run the relative symbolic link command. See the File MenuFile Menu section for more information about symbolic links.

C-x i   set the other panel display mode to information.

C-x q   set the other panel display mode to quick view.

C-x !   execute the External panelizeExternal panelize command.

C-x h   run the add directory to hotlistHotlist command.

Alt-!   executes the Filtered view command, described in the view commandInternal File Viewer.

Alt-?   executes the Find fileFind File command.

Alt-c   pops up the quick cdQuick cd dialog.

C-o     when the program is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or under an xterm, it will show you the output of the previous command. When ran on the Linux console, Midnight Commander uses an external program (cons.saver) to handle saving and restoring of information on the screen.

When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type C-o at any time and you will be taken back to Midnight Commander's main screen, to return to your application just type C-o. If you have an application suspended by using this trick, you won't be able to execute other programs from Midnight Commander until you terminate the suspended application.[Directory Panels]
Directory Panels

This section lists the keys which operate on the directory panels. If you want to know how to change the appearance of the panels take a look at the section on Left and Right MenusLeft and Right Menus.

Tab, C-i
        change the current panel. The old other panel becomes the new current panel and the old current panel becomes the new other panel. The selection bar moves from the old current panel to the new current panel.

Insert, C-t
        to tag files you may use the Insert key (the kich1 terminfo sequence). To untag files, just retag a tagged file.

M-e     to change charset of panel you may use M-e (Alt-e). Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding, select "No translation" in the dialog of encodings.

Alt-g, Alt-r, Alt-j
        used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and the bottom one, respectively.

Alt-t   toggle the current display listing to show the next display listing format. With this it is possible to quickly switch to brief listing, long listing, user defined listing format, and back to the default.

C-\ (control-backslash)
        show the directory hotlistHotlist and change to the selected directory.

+ (plus)
        this is used to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When Files only checkbox is on, only files will be selected. If Files only is off, as files as directories will be selected. When Shell Patterns checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters. If Case sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.

\ (backslash)
        use the "\" key to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the Plus key.

up-key, C-p
        move the selection bar to the previous entry in the panel.

down-key, C-n
        move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel.

home, a1, Alt-<
        move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel.

end, c1, Alt->
        move the selection bar to the last entry in the panel.

next-page, C-v
        move the selection bar one page down.

prev-page, Alt-v
        move the selection bar one page up.

Alt-o   If the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file.

Alt-i   make the current directory of the current panel also the current directory of the other panel. Put the other panel to the listing mode if needed. If the current panel is panelized, the other panel doesn't become panelized.

C-PageUp, C-PageDown
        only when supported by the terminal: change to ".." and to the currently selected directory respectively.

Alt-y   moves to the previous directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the < with the mouse.

Alt-u   moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the > with the mouse.

Alt-Shift-h, Alt-H
        displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the 'v' with the mouse.[Quick search]
Quick search

The Quick search mode allows you to perform fast file search in file panel. Press C-s or Alt-s to start a filename search in the directory listing.

When the search is active, the user input will be added to the search string instead of the command line. If the Show mini-status option is enabled the search string is shown on the mini-status line. When typing, the selection bar will move to the next file starting with the typed letters. The Backspace or DEL keys can be used to correct typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed again, the next match is searched for.

If quick search is started with double pressing of C-s, the previous quick search pattern will be used for current search.

Besides the filename characters, you can also use wildcard characters '*' and '?'.[Shell Command Line]
Shell Command Line

This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive typing when entering shell commands.

Alt-Enter
        copy the currently selected file name to the command line.

C-Enter same a Alt-Enter. May not work on remote systems and some terminals.

C-Shift-Enter
        copy the full path name of the currently selected file to the command line. May not work on remote systems and some terminals.

Alt-Tab does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname completionCompletion for you.

C-x t, C-x C-t
        copy the tagged files (or if there are no tagged files, the selected file) of the current panel (C-x t) or of the other panel (C-x C-t) to the command line.

C-x p, C-x C-p
        the first key sequence copies the current path name to the command line, and the second one copies the unselected panel's path name to the command line.

C-q     the quote command can be used to insert characters that are otherwise interpreted by Midnight Commander (like the '+' symbol)

Alt-p, Alt-n
        use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next one.

Alt-h   displays the history for the current input line.[General Movement Keys]
General Movement Keys

The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use common code to handle moving. Therefore they accept exactly the same keys. Each of them also accepts some keys of its own.

Other parts of Midnight Commander use some of the same movement keys, so this section may be of use for those parts too.

Up, C-p moves one line backward.

Down, C-n
        moves one line forward.

Prev Page, Page Up, Alt-v
        moves one page up.

Next Page, Page Down, C-v
        moves one page down.

Home, A1
        moves to the beginning.

End, C1 move to the end.

The help viewer and the file viewer accept the following keys in addition the to ones mentioned above:

b, C-b, C-h, Backspace, Delete
        moves one page up.

Space bar
        moves one page down.

u, d    moves one half of a page up or down.

g, G    moves to the beginning or to the end.[Input Line Keys]
Input Line Keys

The input lines (they are used for the command lineShell Command Line and for the query dialogs in the program) accept these keys:

C-a     puts the cursor at the beginning of line.

C-e     puts the cursor at the end of the line.

C-b, move-left
        move the cursor one position left.

C-f, move-right
        move the cursor one position right.

Alt-f   moves one word forward.

Alt-b   moves one word backward.

C-h, Backspace
        delete the previous character.

C-d, Delete
        delete the character in the point (over the cursor).

C-@     sets the mark for cutting.

C-w     copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer and removes the text from the input line.

Alt-w   copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer.

C-y     yanks back the contents of the kill buffer.

C-k     kills the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

Alt-p, Alt-n
        Use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next one.

Alt-C-h, Alt-Backspace
        delete one word backward.

Alt-Tab does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname completionCompletion for you.

[Menu Bar]
Menu Bar

The menu bar pops up when you press F9 or click the mouse on the top row of the screen. The menu bar has five menus: "Left", "File", "Command", "Options" and "Right".

The Left and Right MenusLeft and Right Menus allow you to modify the appearance of the left and right directory panels.

The File MenuFile Menu lists the actions you can perform on the currently selected file or the tagged files.

The Command MenuCommand Menu lists the actions which are more general and bear no relation to the currently selected file or the tagged files.

The Options MenuOptions Menu lists the actions which allow you to customize Midnight Commander.[Left and Right Menus]
Left and Right (Above and Below) Menus

The outlook of the directory panels can be changed from the Left and Right menus (they are named Above and Below when the horizontal panel split is chosen from the LayoutLayout options dialog).[Listing Format...]
Listing Format...

The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are four different listing formats available: Full, Brief, Long and User. The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and the modification time.

The brief view shows only the file name and it has from 1 up to 9 columns (therefore showing more files unlike other views). The long view is similar to the output of "ls -l" command. The long view takes the whole screen width.

If you choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify the display format.

The user display format must start with a panel size specifier. This may be "half" or "full", and they specify a half screen panel and a full screen panel respectively.

After the panel size, you may specify how many listings to fit in the panel, side-by-side (in other words: how many times to repeat the fields horizontally). This defaults to 1. You may change this by adding a number from 1 to 9 to the format string.

After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size specifier. This are the available fields you may display:

name    displays the file name.

size    displays the file size.

bsize   is an alternative form of the size format. It displays the size of the files and for directories it just shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.

type    displays a one character wide type field. This character is similar to what is displayed by ls with the -F flag - * for executable files, / for directories, @ for links, = for sockets, - for character devices, + for block devices, | for pipes, ~ for symbolic links to directories and ! for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).

mark    an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it's not.

mtime   file's last modification time.

atime   file's last access time.

ctime   file's status change time.

perm    a string representing the current permission bits of the file.

mode    an octal value with the current permission bits of the file.

nlink   the number of links to the file.

ngid    the GID (numeric).

nuid    the UID (numeric).

owner   the owner of the file.

group   the group of the file.

inode   the inode of the file.

Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:

space   a space in the display format.

|       add a vertical line to the display format.

To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add : followed by the number of characters you want the field to have. If the number is followed by the symbol +, then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the program finds out that there is more space on the screen, it will then expand that field.

For example, the Full display corresponds to this format:

half type name | size | mtime

And the Long display corresponds to this format:

full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space name

This is a nice user display format:

half name | size:7 | type mode:3

Panels may also be set to the following modes:

"Info"  The info view display information related to the currently selected file and if possible information about the current file system.

"Tree"  The tree view is quite similar to the directory treeDirectory Tree feature. See the section about it for more information.

"Quick View"
        In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced viewerInternal File Viewer that displays the contents of the currently selected file, if you select the panel (with the tab key or the mouse), you will have access to the usual viewer commands.[Sort Order...]
Sort Order...

The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modification time, by access time, and by inode information modification time, by size, by inode and unsorted. In the Sort order dialog box you can choose the sort order and you may also specify if you want to sort in reverse order by checking the reverse box.

By default directories are sorted before files but this can be changed from the Panel optionsPanel options menu (option Mix all files).[Filter...]
Filter...

The filter command allows you to specify a shell pattern (for example *.tar.gz) which the files must match to be shown. Regardless of the filter pattern, the directories and the links to directories are always shown in the directory panel.[Reread]
Reread

The reread command reload the list of files in the directory. It is useful if other processes have created or removed files.[File Menu]
File Menu

Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts for commands appearing in the file menu. The escape sequences for the function keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10. On terminals without function key support, you can achieve the same functionality by pressing the ESC key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and 0 (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).

The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in parentheses):

Help (F1)

Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the help viewerContents, you can use the Tab key to select the next link and the Enter key to follow that link. The keys Space and Backspace are used to move forward and backward in a help page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted keys.

Menu (F2)

Invoke the user menuEdit Menu File. The user menu provides an easy way to provide users with a menu and add extra features to Midnight Commander.

View (F3, F13)

View the currently selected file. By default this invokes the Internal File ViewerInternal File Viewer but if the option "Use internal view" is off, it invokes an external file viewer specified by the VIEWER environment variable. If VIEWER is undefined, the PAGER environment variable is tried. If PAGER is also undefined, the "view" command is invoked. If you use F13 instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or preprocessing to the file.

See parameters for external viewerParameters for external editor or viewer for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external viewers.

Filtered View (Alt-!)

This command prompts for a command and its arguments (the argument defaults to the currently selected file name), the output from such command is shown in the internal file viewer.

Edit (F4, F14)

Press F4 to edit the highlighted file. Press F14 (usually F14) to start the editor with a new, empty file. Currently they invoke the vi editor, or the editor specified in the EDITOR environment variable, or the Internal File EditorInternal File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is on.

See parameters for external editorParameters for external editor or viewer for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external editors.

Copy (F5, F15)

Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. Space for destination file may be preallocated relative to preallocate_space configure option. During this process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the operation. For details about source mask (which will be usually either * or ^\(.*\)$ depending on setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination see Mask copy/renameMask Copy/Rename.

F15 (usually F15) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged files.

On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box). The Background JobsBackground jobs is used to control the background process.

Link (C-x l)

Create a hard link to the current file.

Absolute symlink (C-x s)

Create a absolute symbolic link to the current file.

Relative symLink (C-x v)

Create a relative symbolic link to the current file.

To those of you who don't know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like copying the file, but both the source filename and the destination filename represent the same file image. For example, if you edit one of these files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some people call links aliases or shortcuts.

A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of telling which one is the original and which is the link. If you delete either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult to notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when you don't even want to know.

A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If the original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy to notice that the files represent the same image. Midnight Commander shows an "@"-sign in front of the file name if it is a symbolic link to somewhere (except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)). The original file which the link points to is shown on mini-status line if the "Show mini-status" option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the confusion that can be caused by hard links.

When you press "C-x s" Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the complete path+filename of the original file and suggest a name for the link. You can change either one.

Sometimes you may want to change the absolute path of the original into a relative path. An absolute path starts from the root directory:

/home/frodo/mc/mc -> /home/frodo/new/mc

A relative link describes the original file's location starting from the location of the link itself:

/home/frodo/mc/mc -> ../new/mc

You can force Midnight Commander to suggest a relative path by pressing "C-x v" instead of "C-x s".

Rename/Move (F6, F16)

Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more details look at Copy (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar.

F16 (usually F16) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged files.

On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box). The Background JobsBackground jobs is used to control the background process.

Mkdir (F7)

Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.

Delete (F8)

Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in the currently selected panel. During the process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the operation.

Quick cd (Alt-c) Use the quick cdQuick cd command if you have full command line and want to cd somewhere.

Select group (+)

This is used to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When Files only checkbox is on, only files will be selected. If Files only is off, as files as directories will be selected. When Shell Patterns checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters. If Case sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.

Unselect group (\)

Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the "Select group" command.

Quit (F10, Shift-F10)

Terminate Midnight Commander. Shift-F10 is used when you want to quit and you are using the shell wrapper. Shift-F10 will not take you to the last directory you visited with Midnight Commander, instead it will stay at the directory where you started Midnight Commander.[Quick cd]
Quick cd

This command is useful if you have a full command line and want to cdThe cd internal command somewhere without having to yank and paste the command line. This command pops up a small dialog, where you enter everything you would enter after cd on the command line and then you press enter. This features all the things that are already in the internal cd commandThe cd internal command.[Command Menu]
Command Menu

The Directory treeDirectory Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories.

The "Find file"Find File command allows you to search for a specific file.

The "Swap panels" command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.

The "Switch panels on/off" command shows the output of the last shell command. This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console.

The "Compare directories" command compares the directory panels with each other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make the panels identical. There are three compare methods. The quick method compares only file size and file date. The thorough method makes a full byte-by-byte compare. The thorough method is not available if the machine does not support the mmap(2) system call. The size-only compare method just compares the file sizes and does not check the contents or the date times, it just checks the file size.

The "External panelize"External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

The "Command history" command shows a list of typed commands. The selected command is copied to the command line. The command history can also be accessed by typing Alt-p or Alt-n.

The "Directory hotlist"Hotlist command makes changing of the current directory to often used directories faster.

The "Screen list"Screen selector command shows a dialog window with the list of currently running internal editors, viewers and other MC modules that support this mode.

The "Edit extension file"Edit Extension File command allows you to specify programs to executed when you try to execute, view, edit and do a bunch of other thing on files with certain extensions (filename endings).

The "Edit Menu File"Edit Menu File command may be used for editing the user menu (which appears by pressing F2).[Directory Tree]
Directory Tree

The Directory Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories. You can select a directory from the figure and Midnight Commander will change to that directory.

There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command is available from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view from the Left or Right menu.

To get rid of long delays, Midnight Commander creates the tree figure by scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the directory which you want to see is missing, move to its parent directory and press C-r (or F2).

You can use the following keys:

General movement keysGeneral Movement Keys are accepted.

Enter. In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to this directory in the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the current panel.

C-r, F2 (Rescan). Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date: it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories which don't exist any more.

F3 (Forget). Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter from the figure. If you want the directory back to the tree figure press F2 in its parent directory.

F4 (Static/Dynamic). Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static navigation mode.

In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a directory. All known directories are shown.

In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent directory, and the Right key to move to a child directory. Only the parent, sibling and children directories are shown, others are left out. The tree figure changes dynamically as you traverse.

F5 (Copy). Copy the directory.

F6 (RenMov). Move the directory.

F7 (Mkdir). Make a new directory below this directory.

F8 (Delete). Delete this directory from the file system.

C-s, Alt-s. Search the next directory matching the search string. If there is no such directory these keys will move one line down.

C-h, Backspace. Delete the last character of the search string.

Any other character. Add the character to the search string and move to the next directory which starts with these characters. In the tree view you must first activate the search mode by pressing C-s. The search string is shown in the mini status line.

The following actions are available only in the directory tree. They aren't supported in the tree view.

F1 (Help). Invoke the help viewer and show this section.

Esc, F10. Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.

The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like Enter. See also the section on mouse supportMouse Support.[Find File]
Find File

The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the search and the filename to be searched for. By pressing the Tree button you can select the start directory from the directory treeDirectory Tree figure.

The "File name" input field contains a filename pattern to be searched for. It is interpreted as a shell pattern or as a regular expression depending on the state of the "Using shell patterns" checkbox. An empty value is valid and matches any file name.

The "Content" input field contains a string to search for within the files. Leave this field empty to disable searching file contents.

Option "Whole words" allows select only those files containing matches that form whole words. Like grep -w.

You can start the search by pressing the OK button. During the search you can stop from the Stop button and continue from the Start button.

You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow keys. The Chdir button will change to the directory of the currently selected file. The Again button will ask for the parameters for a new search. The Quit button quits the search operation. The Panelize button will place the found files to the current directory panel so that you can do additional operations on them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). To return to the normal file listing, change directory to "..".

The 'Enable ignore directories' checkbox and input field below it allow one to set up the list of directories that should be skip during the search files (for example, you may want to avoid searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that is mounted across a slow link). List components must be separated with a colon, here is an example:

/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs

Relative paths are supported also. The following example shows how to skip special directories of version control systems:
/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs:.svn:.git:CVS

Attention: input field can contain a dot (.), this means the current absolute path.

You may consider using the External panelizeExternal panelize command for some operations. Find file command is for simple queries only, while using External panelize you can do as mysterious searches as you would like.[External panelize]
External panelize

The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

For example, if you want to manipulate in one of the panels all the symbolic links in the current directory, you can use external panelization to run the following command:

find . -type l -print

Upon command completion, the directory contents of the panel will no longer be the directory listing of the current directory, but all the files that are symbolic links.

If you want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded from your FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract the file name from the transfer log files:

awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /var/log/xferlog

You may want to save often used panelize commands under a descriptive name, so that you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing the command on the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a name under which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that command from the list and do not have to type it again.[Hotlist]
Hotlist

The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories in the directory hotlist. Midnight Commander will change to the directory corresponding to the selected label. From the hotlist dialog, you can remove already created label/directory pairs and add new ones. To add new directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command (C-x h), which adds the current directory into the directory hotlist, asking just for the label for the directory.

This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may consider using the CDPATH variable as described in internal cd commandThe cd internal command description.[Edit Extension File]
Edit Extension File

This will invoke your editor on the file ~/.config/mc/mc.ext. The format of this file following:

All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown away.

Lines starting in the first column should have following format:

keyword/expr, i.e. everything after the slash until new line is expr.

keyword can be:

shell   - expr is an extension (no wildcards). File matches it its name ends with expr. Example: shell/.tar matches *.tar.

regex   - expr is a regular expression. File matches if its name matches the regular expression.

directory
        - expr is a regular expression. File matches if it is a directory and its name matches the regular expression.

type    - expr is a regular expression. File matches if the output of file %f without the initial "filename:" part matches regular expression expr.

default - matches any file. expr is ignored.

include - denotes a common section. expr is the name of the section.

Other lines should start with a space or tab and should be of the format: keyword=command (with no spaces around =), where keyword should be: Open (invoked on Enter or double click), View (F3), Edit (F4) or Include (to add rules from the common section). command is any one-line shell command, with the simple macro substitutionMacro Substitution.

Rules are matched from top to bottom, thus the order is important. If the appropriate action is missing, search continues as if this rule didn't match (i.e. if a file matches the first and second entry and View action is missing in the first one, then on pressing F3 the View action from the second entry will be used). default should match all the actions.[Background jobs]
Background Jobs

This lets you control the state of any background Midnight Commander process (only copy and move files operations can be done in the background). You can stop, restart and kill a background job from here.[Edit Menu File]
Edit Menu File

The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the user. When you access the user menu, the file .mc.menu from the current directory is used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root and is not world-writable. If no such file found, ~/.config/mc/menu is tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu /gearlock/share/mc/mc.menu.

The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with anything but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in order to be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should be a letter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are the commands that will be executed when the entry is selected.

When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are copied to a temporary file in the temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then that file is executed. This allows the user to put normal shell constructs in the menus. Also simple macro substitution takes place before executing the menu code. For more information, see macro substitutionMacro Substitution.

Here is a sample mc.menu file:

A	Dump the currently selected file
	od -c %f

B	Edit a bug report and send it to root
	I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
	vi $I
	mail -s "Midnight Commander bug" root < $I
	rm -f $I

M	Read mail
	emacs -f rmail

N	Read Usenet news
	emacs -f gnus

H	Call the info hypertext browser
	info

J	Copy current directory to other panel recursively
	tar cf - . | (cd %D && tar xvpf -)

K	Make a release of the current subdirectory
	echo -n "Name of distribution file: "
	read tar
	ln -s %d `dirname %d`/$tar
	cd ..
	tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar

= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
X       Extract the contents of a compressed tar file
	tar xzvf %f

Default Conditions

Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must start from the first column with a '=' character. If the condition is true, the menu entry will be the default entry.

Condition syntax: 	= <sub-cond>
  or:			= <sub-cond> | <sub-cond> ...
  or:			= <sub-cond> & <sub-cond> ...

Sub-condition is one of following:

  y <pattern>		syntax of current file matching pattern?
			(for edit menu only)
  f <pattern>		current file matching pattern?
  F <pattern>		other file matching pattern?
  d <pattern>		current directory matching pattern?
  D <pattern>		other directory matching pattern?
  t <type>		current file of type?
  T <type>		other file of type?
  x <filename>		is it executable filename?
  ! <sub-cond>		negate the result of sub-condition

Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according to the shell patterns option. You can override the global value of the shell patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the first line of the menu file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).

Type is one or more of the following characters:

  n	not a directory
  r	regular file
  d	directory
  l	link
  c	character device
  b	block device
  f	FIFO (pipe)
  s	socket
  x	executable file
  t	tagged

For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo. The 't' type is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of the file. The condition '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the current panel and false if not.

If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will be shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated.

The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
	= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
is calculated as
	( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)

Here is a sample of the use of conditions:

= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
L	List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
	gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -

Addition Conditions

If the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it is an addition condition. If the condition is true the menu entry will be included in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will not be included in the menu.

You can combine default and addition conditions by starting condition with '+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you want to use two different conditions, one for adding and another for defaulting, you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one starting with '+' and another starting with '='.

Comments are started with '#'. The additional comment lines must start with '#', space or tab.[Options Menu]
Options Menu

Midnight Commander has some options that may be toggled on and off in several dialogs which are accessible from this menu. Options are enabled if they have an asterisk or "x" in front of them.

The ConfigurationConfiguration command pops up a dialog from which you can change most of settings of Midnight Commander.

The LayoutLayout command pops up a dialog from which you specify a bunch of options how mc looks like on the screen.

The Panel optionsPanel options command pops up a dialog from which you specify options of file manager panels.

The ConfirmationConfirmation command pops up a dialog from which you specify which actions you want to confirm.

The AppearanceAppearance command pops up a dialog from which you specify the skin.

The Display bitsDisplay bits command pops up a dialog from which you may select which characters is your terminal able to display.

The Learn keysLearn keys command pops up a dialog from which you test some keys which are not working on some terminals and you may fix them.

The Virtual FSVirtual FS command pops up a dialog from which you specify some VFS related options.

The Save setupSave Setup command saves the current settings of the Left, Right and Options menus. A small number of other settings is saved, too.[Configuration]
Configuration

The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: "File operation options", "Esc key mode", "Pause after run" and "Other options".

File operation options

Verbose operation. This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation). If you have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is less than 9600 bps.

Compute totals. If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander computes total byte sizes and total number of files prior to any Copy, Rename and Delete operations. This will provide you with a more accurate progress bar at the expense of some speed. This option has no effect, if Verbose operation is disabled.

Classic progressbar. If this option is enabled, the progressbar of Copy/Move/Delete operations is always grown form left to right. If disabled, the growing direction of progressbar follows to direction of Copy/Move/Delete operation: from left panel to right one and vice versa. Enabled by default.

Mkdir autoname. When you press F7 to create a new directory, the input line in popup dialog will be filled by name of current file or directory in active panel. Disabled by default.

Preallocate space. Preallocate space for whole target file, if possible, before copy operation. Disabled by default.

Esc key mode.

By default, Midnight Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix. Therefore, you should press Esc code twice to exit a dialog. But there is a possibility to use a single press of ESC key for that action.

Single press. By default this option is disabled. If you'll enable it, the ESC key will act as a prefix key for set up time interval (see Timeout option below), and if no extra keys have arrived, then the ESC key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).

Timeout. This options is used to setup the time interval (in microseconds) for single press of ESC key. By default, this interval is one second (1000000 microseconds). Also the timeout can be set via KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US environment variable (also in microseconds), which has higher priority than Timeout option value.

Pause after run

After executing your commands, Midnight Commander can pause, so that you can examine the output of the command. There are three possible settings for this variable:

Never. Means that you do not want to see the output of your command. If you are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to see the output of the command by typing C-o.

On dumb terminals. You will get the pause message on terminals that are not capable of showing the output of the last command executed (any terminal that is not an xterm or the Linux console).

Always. The program will pause after executing all of your commands.

Other options

Use internal editor. If this option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in the EDITOR environment variable is used. If no editor is specified, vi is used. See the section on the internal file editorInternal File Editor.

Use internal viewer. If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified in the PAGER environment variable is used. If no pager is specified, the view command is used. See the section on the internal file viewerInternal File Viewer.

Ask new file name. If this option is enabled, file name is asked before open new file in editor.

Auto menus. If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup. Useful for building menus for non-unixers.

Drop down menus. When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will be activated as soon as you press the F9 key. Otherwise, you will only get the menu title, and you will have to activate the menu either with the arrow keys or with the hotkeys. It is recommended if you are using hotkeys.

Shell Patterns. By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will use shell-like regular expressions. The following conversions are performed to achieve this: the '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more characters); the '?' is replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and '.' by the literal dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the ones described in ed(1).

Complete: show all. By default, Midnight Commander pops up all possible completionsCompletion if the completion is ambiguous only when you press Alt-Tab for the second time. For the first time, it just completes as much as possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity. Enable this option if you want to see all possible completions even after pressing Alt-Tab the first time.

Rotating dash. If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper right corner as a work in progress indicator.

Cd follows links. This option, if set, causes Midnight Commander to follow the logical chain of directories when changing current directory either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default behavior of bash. When unset, Midnight Commander follows the real directory structure, so cd .. if you've entered that directory through a link will move you to the current directory's real parent and not to the directory where the link was present.

Safe delete. If this option is enabled, deleting files and directory hotlist entries unintentionally becomes more difficult. The default selection in the confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from Yes to No. This option is disabled by default.

Safe overwrite. If this option is enabled, overwriting files unintentionally becomes more difficult. The default selection in the overwrite confirmation dialog changes from Yes to No. This option is disabled by default.

Auto save setup. If this option is enabled, when you exit Midnight Commander, the configurable options of Midnight Commander are saved in the ~/.config/mc/ini file.[Layout]
Layout

The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general layout of screen. The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: "Panel split", "Console output" and "Other options".

Panel split

The rest of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You can specify whether the area is split to the panels in Vertical or Horizontal direction. Panel layout can be changed using Alt-, (Alt-comma) shortcut.

Equal split. By default, panels have equal sizes. Using this option you can specify an unequal split.

Console output

On the Linux or FreeBSD console you can specify how many lines are shown in the output window. This option is available if Midnight Commander runs on native console only.

Other options

Menu bar visible. If enabled, main menu of Midnight Commander is always visible on the top row of screen above panels. Enabled by default.

Command prompt. If enabled, command line is available. Enabled by default.

Keybar visible. If enabled, 10 labels associated with F1-F10 keys are located at the bottom row of screen. Enabled by default.

Hintbar visible. If enabled, the one-line hints are visible below panels. Enabled by default.

XTerm window title. When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight Commander sets the terminal window title to the current working directory and updates it when necessary. If your terminal emulator is broken and you see some incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off this option. Enabled by default.

Show free space. If enabled, free space and total space of current file system is shown at the bottom frame of panel. Enabled by default.[Panel options]
Panel options

Main panel options

Show mini-status. If enabled, one line of status information about the currently selected item is shown at the bottom of the panels. Enabled by default.

Use SI size units. If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use SI prefixes (base 10) when displaying any byte sizes. If disabled (default), Midnight Commander will use IEC prefixes (base 2).

Mix all files. If this option is enabled, all files and directories are shown mixed together. If the option is disabled (default), directories (and links to directories) are shown at the beginning of the listing, and other files below.

Show backup files. If enabled, Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde. Otherwise, they won't be shown (like GNU's ls option -B). Enabled by default.

Show hidden files. If enabled, Midnight Commander will show all files that start with a dot (like ls -a). Disabled by default.

Fast directory reload. If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use a trick to determine if the directory contents have changed. The trick is to reload the directory only if the i-node of the directory has changed; this means that reloads only happen when files are created or deleted. If what changes is the i-node for a file in the directory (file size changes, mode or owner changes, etc) the display is not updated. In these cases, if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory manually (with C-r). Disabled by default.

Mark moves down. If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you mark a file (with Insert key). Enabled by default.

Reverse files only. Allow revert selection of files only. Enabled by default. If enabled, the reverse selection is applied to files only, not to directories. The selection of directories is untouched. If off, the reverse selection is applied to files as well to directories: all unselected items become selected, and vice versa.

Simple swap. If both panels contain file listing, simple swap means that panels exchange its screen positions: left panel become right one, and vice versa. If this option is unchecked, file listing panels exchange its content keeping listing format and sort options. Unchecked by default.

Auto save panels setup. If this option is enabled, when you exit Midnight Commander, the current settings of panels are saved in the ~/.config/mc/panels.ini file. Disabled by default.

Navigation

Lynx-like motion. If this option is enabled, you may use the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the current selection is a subdirectory and the shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off.

Page scrolling. If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when the cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel, otherwise it will just scroll a file at a time.

Center scrolling. If set, panel will scroll when the cursor reaches the middle of the panel column, only hitting the top or bottom of the panel when actually on the first or last file. This behavior applies when scrolling one file at a time, and does not apply to the page up/down keys.

Mouse page scrolling. Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse wheel is done by pages or line by line on the panels.

File highlight

You can specify whether permissions and file types should be highlighted with distinctive ColorsColors. If the permission highlighting is enabled, the parts of the perm and mode display fieldsListing Format... which apply to the user running Midnight Commander are highlighted with the color defined by the selected keyword. If the file type highlighting is enabled, file names are colored according to rules described in /gearlock/etc/mc/filehighlight.ini file. See Filenames HighlightFilenames Highlight for more info.

Quick search

You can specify how the Quick searchQuick search mode should work: case insensitively, case sensitively or be matched to the panel sort order: case sensitive or not.[Confirmation]
Confirmation

In this dialog you configure the confirmation options for file deletion, overwriting files, execution by pressing enter, quitting the program, directory hotlist entries deletion and history cleanup.[Appearance]
Appearance

In this dialog you can select the skin to be used.

See the SkinsSkins section for technical details about the skin definition files.[Display bits]
Display bits

This is used to configure the range of visible characters on the screen. This setting may be 7-bits if your terminal/curses supports only seven output bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display full 8 bit characters.[Learn keys]
Learn keys

This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys, cursor arrows and some other keys to make them work properly on your terminal. They often don't, since many terminal databases are incomplete or broken.

You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys ('h' left, 'j' down, 'k' up and 'l' right). Once you press any cursor movement key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well.

You can test keys just by pressing each of them. When you press a key and it is recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name of that key. Once a key is marked OK it starts working as usually, e.g. F1 pressed the first time will just check that the F1 key works, but after that it will show help. The same applies to the arrow keys. The Tab key should be working always.

If some keys do not work properly then you won't see OK appear after pressing one of these. Then you may want to redefine it. Do it by pressing the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or by Enter or Space after selecting the button with Tab or arrows). Then a message box will appear asking you to press that key. Do it and wait until the message box disappears. If you want to abort, just press Escape once and wait.

When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them. The definitions for the keys you have redefined will be written into the [terminal:TERM] section of your ~/.config/mc/ini file (where TERM is the name of your current terminal). The definitions of the keys that were already working properly are not saved.[Virtual FS]
Virtual FS

This option gives you control over the settings of the Virtual File SystemVirtual File System.

Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some of the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).

Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example, compressed tar files), Midnight Commander needs to create temporary uncompressed files on your disk.

Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk take up resources, you may want to tune the parameters of the cached information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of access to frequently used file systems.

Because of the format of the tar archives, the Tar filesystem needs to read the whole file just to load the file entries. Since most tar files are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk in a temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as a regular tar file.

Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk, it's common that you will leave a tar file and then re-enter it later. Since decompression is slow, Midnight Commander will cache the information in memory for a limited time. When the timeout expires, all the resources associated with the file system are released. The default timeout is set to one minute.

The FTP File SystemFTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote FTP servers. It has several options.

ftp anonymous password is the password used when you login as "anonymous". Some sites require a valid e-mail address. On the other hand, you probably don't want to give your real e-mail address to untrusted sites, especially if you are not using spam filtering.

ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache. The cache expire time is configurable with the ftpfs directory cache timeout option. A low value for this option may slow down every operation on the ftpfs because every operation would require sending a request to the FTP server.

You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP. Note that most modern firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP (see below), so FTP proxies are considered obsolete.

If Always use ftp proxy is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain hosts. See FTP File SystemFTP File System for examples.

If this option is set, the program will do two things: consult the /gearlock/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names that are local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a domain) and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are directly accessible. All other hosts will be accessed through the specified FTP proxy.

You can enable using ~/.netrc file, which keeps login names and passwords for ftp servers. See netrc (5) for the description of the .netrc format.

Use passive mode enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection for data transfer is initiated by the client, not by the server. This option is recommended and enabled by default. If this option is turned off, the data connection is initiated by the server. This may not work with some firewalls.[Save Setup]
Save Setup

At startup, Midnight Commander tries to load initialization information from the ~/.config/mc/ini file. If this file doesn't exist, the system-wide file /gearlock/etc/mc/mc.ini is used. If this file doesn't exist, the system-wide file /gearlock/share/mc/mc.ini is used. If this file doesn't exist, MC uses the default settings.

The Save Setup command creates the ~/.config/mc/ini file by saving the current settings of the Left, RightLeft and Right Menus and OptionsOptions Menu menus.

If you activate the auto save setup option, MC will always save the current settings when exiting.

There also exist settings which can't be changed from the menus. To change these settings you have to edit the setup file with your favorite editor. See the section on Special SettingsSpecial Settings for more information.

[Executing operating system commands]
Executing operating system commands

You may execute commands by typing them directly in Midnight Commander's input line, or by selecting the program you want to execute with the selection bar in one of the panels and hitting Enter.

If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, Midnight Commander checks the extension of the selected file against the extensions in the Extensions FileEdit Extension File. If a match is found then the code associated with that extension is executed. A very simple macro expansionMacro Substitution takes place before executing the command.[The cd internal command]
The cd internal command

The cd command is interpreted by Midnight Commander, it is not passed to the command shell for execution. Thus it may not handle all of the nice macro expansion and substitution that your shell does, although it does some of them:

Tilde substitution. The (~) will be substituted with your home directory, if you append a username after the tilde, then it will be substituted with the login directory of the specified user.

For example, ~guest is the home directory for the user guest, while ~/guest is the directory guest in your home directory.

Previous directory. You can jump to the directory you were previously by using the special directory name '-' like this: cd -

CDPATH directories. If the directory specified to the cd command is not in the current directory, then Midnight Commander uses the value in the environment variable CDPATH to search for the directory in any of the named directories.

For example you could set your CDPATH variable to ~/src:/usr/src, allowing you to change your directory to any of the directories inside the ~/src and /usr/src directories, from any place in the file system by using its relative name (for example cd linux could take you to /usr/src/linux).[Macro Substitution]
Macro Substitution

When accessing a user menuEdit Menu File, or executing an extension dependent commandEdit Extension File, or running a command from the command line input, a simple macro substitution takes place.

The macros are:

%i      The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column position. For edit menu only.

%y      The syntax type of current file. For edit menu only.

%k      The block file name.

%e      The error file name.

%m      The current menu name.

%f and %p
        In file manager user menu: the current file name in selected panel. In mcedit user menu: the name of opened file.

%x      The extension of current file name.

%b      The current file name without extension.

%d      The current directory name.

%F      The current file in the unselected panel.

%D      The directory name of the unselected panel.

%t      The currently tagged files.

%T      The tagged files in the unselected panel.

%u and %U
        Similar to the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files are untagged. You can use this macro only once per menu file entry or extension file entry, because next time there will be no tagged files.

%s and %S
        The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the current file.

%cd     This is a special macro that is used to change the current directory to the directory specified in front of it. This is used primarily as an interface to the Virtual File SystemVirtual File System.

%view   This macro is used to invoke the internal viewer. This macro can be used alone, or with arguments. If you pass any arguments to this macro, they should be enclosed in brackets.

        The arguments are: ascii to force the viewer into ascii mode; hex to force the viewer into hex mode; nroff to tell the viewer that it should interpret the bold and underline sequences of nroff; unformatted to tell the viewer to not interpret nroff commands for making the text bold or underlined.

%%      The % character

%{some text}
        Prompt for the substitution. An input box is shown and the text inside the braces is used as a prompt. The macro is substituted by the text typed by the user. The user can press ESC or F10 to cancel. This macro doesn't work on the command line yet.

%var{ENV:default}
        If environment variable ENV is unset, the default is substituted. Otherwise, the value of ENV is substituted.[The subshell support]
The subshell support

The subshell support is a compile time option, that works with the shells: bash, ash (BusyBox and Debian), tcsh, zsh and fish.

When the subshell support is active, Midnight Commander will spawn a concurrent copy of your shell (the one defined in the SHELL variable and if it is not defined, then the one in the /etc/passwd file) and run it in a pseudo terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you execute a command, the command will be passed to the subshell as if you had typed it. This also allows you to change the environment variables, use shell functions and define aliases that are valid until you quit Midnight Commander.

bash users may specify startup commands in ~/.local/share/mc/bashrc (fallback ~/.bashrc) and special keyboard maps in ~/.local/share/mc/inputrc (fallback ~/.inputrc).

ash/dash users (BusyBox or Debian) may specify startup commands in ~/.local/share/mc/ashrc (fallback ~/.profile).

tcsh, zsh, fish users cannot specify mc-specific startup commands at present. They have to rely on shell-specific startup files.

The following paragraphs are relevant only when the subshell support is active:

You can suspend applications at any time with the sequence C-o and jump back to Midnight Commander, if you interrupt an application, you will not be able to run other external commands until you quit the application you interrupted.

The basic prompt displayed by Midnight Commander is of the form "user@host:current_path$ ". When using a capable shell, like Bash, the prompt displayed by Midnight Commander will be the same prompt that you are currently using in your shell.

(There's a known problem when using fish: the prompt is displayed only in full screen mode (Ctrl-o), not when the panels are visible.)

The OPTIONSOPTIONS section has more information on how you can control subshell usage (-U/-u). Furthermore, to set a specific subshell different from your current SHELL variable or login shell defined in /etc/passwd, you may call MC like this: SHELL=/bin/myshell mc[Chmod]
Chmod

The Chmod window is used to change the attribute bits in a group of files and directories. It can be invoked with the C-x c key combination.

The Chmod window has two parts - Permissions and File.

In the File section are displayed the name of the file or directory and its permissions in octal form, as well as its owner and group.

In the Permissions section there is a set of check buttons which correspond to the file attribute bits. As you change the attribute bits, you can see the octal value change in the File section.

To move between the widgets (buttons and check buttons) use the arrow keys or the Tab key. To change the state of the check buttons or to select a button use Space. You can also use the hotkeys on the buttons to quickly activate them. Hotkeys are shown as highlighted letters on the buttons.

To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.

When working with a group of files or directories, you just click on the bits you want to set or clear. Once you have selected the bits you want to change, you select one of the action buttons (Set marked or Clear marked).

Finally, to set the attributes exactly to those specified, you can use the [Set all] button, which will act on all the tagged files.

[Marked all] set only marked attributes to all selected files

[Set marked] set marked bits in attributes of all selected files

[Clean marked] clear marked bits in attributes of all selected files

[Set] set the attributes of one file

[Cancel] cancel the Chmod command[Chown]
Chown

The Chown command is used to change the owner/group of a file. The hot key for this command is C-x o.[Advanced Chown]
Advanced Chown

The Advanced Chown command is the ChmodChmod and ChownChown command combined into one window. You can change the permissions and owner/group of files at once.[File Operations]
File Operations

When you copy, move or delete files, Midnight Commander shows the file operations dialog. It shows the files currently being processed and uses up to three progress bars. The file bar indicates the percentage of the current file that has been processed so far. The count bar shows how many of the tagged files have been handled. The bytes bar indicates the percentage of the total size of the tagged files that has been handled. If the verbose option is off, the file and bytes bars are not shown.

There are two buttons at the bottom of the dialog. Pressing the Skip button will skip the rest of the current file. Pressing the Abort button will abort the whole operation, the rest of the files are skipped.

There are three other dialogs which you can run into during the file operations.

The error dialog informs about error conditions and has three choices. Normally you select either the Skip button to skip the file or the Abort button to abort the operation altogether. You can also select the Retry button if you fixed the problem from another terminal.

The replace dialog is shown when you attempt to copy or move a file on the top of an existing file. The dialog shows the dates and sizes of the both files. Press the Yes button to overwrite the file, the No button to skip the file, the All button to overwrite all the files, the None button to never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if the source file is newer than the target file. You can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort button.

The recursive delete dialog is shown when you try to delete a directory which is not empty. Press the Yes button to delete the directory recursively, the No button to skip the directory, the All button to delete all the directories and the None button to skip all the non-empty directories. You can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort button. If you selected the Yes or All button you will be asked for a confirmation. Type "yes" only if you are really sure you want to do the recursive delete.

If you have tagged files and perform an operation on them only the files on which the operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and skipped files are left tagged.[Mask Copy/Rename]
Mask Copy/Rename

The copy/move operations let you translate the names of files in an easy way. To do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and usually in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards. All the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to the target mask. If there are tagged files, only the tagged files matching the source mask are renamed.

There are other options which you can set:

Follow links

determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source directory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target directory or whether would you like to copy their content.

Dive into subdirs

determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied, but the target directory already exists. The default action is to copy the contents of the source directory into the target directory. Enabling this option causes copying the source directory itself into the target directory.

For example, you want to copy directory /foo containing file bar to /bla/foo, which is an already existing directory. Normally (when Dive into subdirs is not set), mc would copy file /foo/bar into the file /bla/foo/bar. By enabling this option the /bla/foo/foo directory will be created, and /foo/bar will be copied into /bla/foo/foo/bar.

Preserve attributes

determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you are root) the ownership of the original files. If this option is not set, the current value of the umask will be respected.

Use shell patterns

When this option is on you can use the '*' and '?' wildcards in the source mask. They work like they do in the shell. In the target mask only the '*' and '\<digit>' wildcards are allowed. The first '*' wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask, the second '*' corresponds to the second group and so on. The '\1' wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask, the '\2' wildcard corresponds to the second group and so on all the way up to '\9'. The '\0' wildcard is the whole filename of the source file.

Two examples:

If the source mask is "*.tar.gz", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "foo.tgz" in "/bla".

Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would become "c.file" and so on. The source mask for this is "*.*" and the destination is "\2.\1".

Use shell patterns off

When the shell patterns option is off the MC doesn't do automatic grouping anymore. You must use '\(...\)' expressions in the source mask to specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is more flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks are similar to the situation when the shell patterns option is on.

Two examples:

If the source mask is "^\(.*\)\.tar\.gz$", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "/bla/foo.tgz".

Let's suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" will become "c.file" and so on. The source mask for this is "^\(.*\)\.\(.*\)$" and the destination is "\2.\1".

Case Conversions

You can also change the case of the filenames. If you use '\u' or '\l' in the target mask, the next character will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.

If you use '\U' or '\L' in the target mask, the next characters will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the next '\E' or next '\U', '\L' or the end of the file name.

The '\u' and '\l' are stronger than '\U' and '\L'.

For example, if the source mask is '*' ( Use shell patterns on) or '^\(.*\)$' ( Use shell patterns off) and the target mask is '\L\u*' the file names will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower case.

You can also use '\' as a quote character. For example, '\\' is a backslash and '\*' is an asterisk.

Stable symlinks

commands Midnight Commander, that it should change symlinks in the target, so that they'll point to the same location as it did before. With absolute symbolic links this does nothing, but if you have a relative one, it will recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and other directory parts and making the value as short as possible (most modern filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and thus don't waste much disk space).[Select/Unselect Files]
Select/Unselect Files

The dialog of group of files and directories selection or uselection. The input lineInput Line Keys allow enter the regular expression of filenames that will be selected/unselected.

When Files only checkbox is on, only files will be selected. If Files only is off, as files as directories will be selected. When Shell Patterns checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters. If Case sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.[Diff Viewer]
Internal Diff Viewer

The mcdiff is a visual diff tool. You can compare two files and edit them in-place (diffs are updated dynamically). You can browse and view a working copy from popular version control systems (GIT, Subversion, etc).

Following shortcuts are available in internal diff viewer of Midnight Commander.

F1 Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.

F2 Save modified files.

F4 Edit file of the left panel in the internal editor.

F14 Edit file of the right panel in the internal editor.

Home, A1 Moves to the line beginning.

End Moves to the line end.

C-Home Move to the file beginning.

C-End, C1 Move to the file end.[Internal File Viewer]
Internal File Viewer

The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII and hex. To toggle between modes, use the F4 key.

The viewer will try to use the best method provided by your system or the file type to display the information. Some character sequences, which appear most often in preformatted manual pages, are displayed bold and underlined, thus making a pretty display of your files.

When in hex mode, the search function accepts text in quotes and constant numbers. Text in quotes is matched exactly after removing the quotes. Each number matches one byte. You can mix quoted text with constants like this:

"String" 34 0xBB 012 "more text"

Numbers are always interpreted in hex. In the example above, "34" is interpreted as 0x34. The prefix "0x" isn't really needed: we could type "BB" instead of "0xBB". And "012" is interpreted as 0x12, not as an octal number.

Here is a listing of the actions associated with each key that the Midnight Commander handles in the internal file viewer.

F1 Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.

F2 Toggle the wrap mode.

F4 Toggle the hex mode.

F5 Goto. You can specify a line number, offset or percentage of file size of position that you want to view.

F7, /, ? Start search. These keys call the dialog window that allows you to set up the search options. If key is ? the "Backwards" option is on.

C-s Continue forward search.

C-r Continue reverse search.

F17, n Continue search in the chosen direction.

N Temporary change the search direction: backwards if forward search is chosen, and vice versa.

F8 Toggle Raw/Parsed mode: This will show the file as found on disk or if a processing filter has been specified in the mc.ext file, then the output from the filter. Current mode is always the other than written on the button label, since on the button is the mode which you enter by that key.

F9 Toggle the format/unformat mode: when format mode is on the viewer will interpret some string sequences to show bold and underline with different colors. Also, on button label is the other mode than current.

F10, Esc. Exit the internal file viewer.

next-page, space, C-v. Scroll one page forward.

prev-page, Alt-v, C-b, Backspace. Scroll one page backward.

down-key Scroll one line forward.

up-key Scroll one line backward.

C-l Refresh the screen.

C-o Switch to the subshell and show the command screen.

"[n] m" Set the mark n.

"[n] r" Jump to the mark n.

C-f Jump to the next file.

C-b Jump to the previous file.

Alt-r Toggle the ruler.

Alt-e to change charset of displayed text may use M-e (Alt-e). Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may select "<No translation>" in charset selection dialog.

It's possible to instruct the file viewer how to display a file, look at the Edit Extension File sectionEdit Extension File[Internal File Editor]
Internal File Editor

The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor. It can edit files up to 64 megabytes. It is possible to edit binary files. The internal file editor is invoked using F4 if the use_internal_edit option is set in the initialization file.

The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro commands; regular expression search and replace; shift-arrow text highlighting (if supported by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like indent and ispell.

Sections:

        Options of editor in ini-fileInternal File Editor / options

The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what keys do what, just consult the appropriate pull-down menu. Other keys are: Shift movement keys do text highlighting. Ctrl-Ins copies to the file mcedit.clip and Shift-Ins pastes from mcedit.clip. Shift-Del cuts to mcedit.clip, and Ctrl-Del deletes highlighted text. Mouse highlighting also works, and you can override the mouse as usual by holding down the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal terminal mouse highlighting work.

To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the key strokes you want to be executed. Press Ctrl-R again when finished. You can then assign the macro to any key you like by pressing that key. The macro is executed when you press Ctrl-A and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key is not used for any other function. Once defined, the macro commands go into the file ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros You can delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line in this file.

To change charset of displayed text may use M-e (Alt-e). Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may select "<No translation>" in charset selection dialog.

F19 will format the currently highlighted block (plain text or C or C++ code or another). This is controlled by the file /gearlock/share/mc/edit.indent.rc which is copied to ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc in your home directory the first time you use it.

The editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When editing binary files, you should set display bits to 7 bits in the options menu to keep the spacing clean.[Internal File Editor / options]
Options of editor in ini-file

Some editor options of ini-file are described in this section. Options are placed in [Midnight-Commander] section

editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file
        Search autocomplete candidates in entire of file or just from begin of file to cursor position (0)[Screen selector]
Screen selector

Midnight Commander supports running many internal modules (such as editor, viewer and diff viewer) simultaneously and switching between them without closing open files. Using several file managers at a time, however, is not currently supported.

Let's call each of these modules a screen. There are three ways to switch between screens, using one of these global shortcuts:

Alt-}   switch to the next screen;

Alt-{   switch to the previous screen;

Alt-`   open a dialog window with the list of currently open screens (or use the "Screen list" menu item).[Completion]
Completion

Let Midnight Commander type for you.

Attempt to perform completion on the text before current position. MC attempts completion treating the text as variable (if the text begins with $), username (if the text begins with ~), hostname (if the text begins with @) or command (if you are on the command line in the position where you might type a command, possible completions then include shell reserved words and shell built-in commands as well) in turn. If none of these matches, filename completion is attempted.

Filename, username, variable and hostname completion works on all input lines, command completion is command line specific. If the completion is ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps and the following action depends on the setting of the Complete: show allConfiguration option in the ConfigurationConfiguration dialog. If it is enabled, a list of all possibilities pops up next to the current position and you can select with the arrow keys and Enter the correct entry. You can also type the first letters in which the possibilities differ to move to a subset of all possibilities and complete as much as possible. If you press Alt-Tab again, only the subset will be shown in the listbox, otherwise the first item which matches all the previous characters will be highlighted. As soon as there is no ambiguity, dialog disappears, but you can hide it by canceling keys Esc, F10 and left and right arrow keys. If Complete: show allConfiguration is disabled, the dialog pops up only if you press Alt-Tab for the second time, for the first time MC just beeps.

Apply escaping of ?, * and & symbols (as fB\?fR, fB\*fR, fB\&fR ) in filenames to disallow use them as metasymbols in regular expressions when substitution is performed in the input line.[Virtual File System]
Virtual File System

Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file system; this code layer is known as the virtual file system switch. The virtual file system switch allows Midnight Commander to manipulate files not located on the Unix file system.

Currently, Midnight Commander is packaged with some Virtual File Systems (VFS): the local file system, used for accessing the regular Unix file system; the ftpfs, used to manipulate files on remote systems with the FTP protocol; the tarfs, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files; the undelfs, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file systems (the default file system for Linux systems), fish (for manipulating files over shell connections such as rsh and ssh). If the code was compiled with sftpfs (for manipulating files over SFTP connections). If the code was compiled with smbfs support, you can manipulate files on remote systems with the SMB (CIFS) protocol.

A generic extfs (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to easily expand VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.

The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one of the file systems is described later in their own section.[FTP File System]
FTP File System

The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote machines. To actually use it, you can use the FTP link item in the menu or directly change your current directory using the cd command to a path name that looks like this:

ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]

The user, port and remote-dir elements are optional. If you specify the user element, Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login name from the ~/.netrc file. The optional pass element is the password used for the connection. Using the password in the VFS directory name is not recommended, because it can appear on the screen in clear text and can be saved to the directory history.

To enable using FTP proxy, prepend ! (an exclamation sign) to the hostname.

Examples:

    ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
    ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
    ftp://!behind.firewall.edu/pub
    ftp://guest@remote-host.com:40/pub
    ftp://miguel:xxx@server/pub

Please check the Virtual File SystemVirtual FS dialog box for ftpfs options.[Tar File System]
Tar File System

The tar file system provides you with read-only access to your tar files and compressed tar files by using the chdir command. To change your directory to a tar file, you change your current directory to the tar file by using the following syntax:

/filename.tar/utar://[dir-inside-tar]

The mc.ext file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means that usually you just point to a tar file and press return to enter into the tar file, see the Edit Extension FileEdit Extension File section for details on how this is done.

Examples:

    mc-3.0.tar.gz/utar://mc-3.0/vfs
    /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar/utar://

The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.[FIle transfer over SHell filesystem]
FIle transfer over SHell filesystem

The fish file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were local. To use this, the other side has to either run fish server, or has to have bash-compatible shell.

To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the following format:

sh://[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]

The user, options and remote-dir elements are optional. If you specify the user element, Midnight Commander will try to login on the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.

The available options are:
  'C' - use compression;
  'r' - use rsh instead of ssh;
  port - specify the port used by remote server.
If the remote-dir element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be set to this one.

Examples:

    sh://onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
    sh://joe@want.compression.edu:C/private
    sh://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
    sh://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private
[SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) filesystem]
SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) filesystem

The SFTP file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were local.

To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the following format:

sftp://[user@]machine:[port]/[remote-dir]

The user, port and remote-dir elements are optional. If you specify the user element, Midnight Commander will try to login on the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name. port - specify the port used by remote server (22 by default). If the remote-dir element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be set to this one.

Examples:

    sftp://onlyrsh.mx/linux/local
    sftp://joe:password@want.compression.edu/private
    sftp://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
    sftp://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private
[Undelete File System]
Undelete File System

On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use the ext2fs undelete facilities, you will have the undelete file system available. Recovery of deleted files is only available on ext2 file systems. The undelete file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve all of the deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and to extract the selected files into a regular partition.

To use this file system, you have to chdir into the special file name formed by the "undel://" prefix and the file name where the actual file system resides.

For example, to recover deleted files on the second partition of the first SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the following path name:

    undel://sda2

It may take a while for the undelfs to load the required information before you start browsing files there.[SMB File System]
SMB File System

The smbfs allows you to manipulate files on remote machines with SMB (or CIFS) protocol. These include Windows for Workgroups, Windows 9x/ME/XP, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Samba. To actually use it, you may try to use the panel command "SMB link..." (accessible from the menubar) or you may directly change your current directory to it using the cd command to a path name that looks like this:

smb://[user@]machine[/service][/remote-dir]

The user, service and remote-dir elements are optional. The user, domain and password can be specified in an input dialog.

Examples:

    smb://machine/Share
    smb://other_machine
    smb://guest@machine/Public/Irlex
[EXTernal File System]
EXTernal File System

extfs allows you to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.

Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:

1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing file. They represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree. You can invoke them by typing "cd fsname://" where fsname is an extfs short name (see below). Examples of such filesystems include audio (list audio tracks on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in the system).

For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type

  cd audio://

2. 'Archive' filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent contents of a file as a directory tree. It can consist of 'real' files compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a mailbox (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs). To access such filesystems fsname:// should be appended to the archive name. Note that the archive itself can be on another vfs.

For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type

  cd documents.zip/uzip://

In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory. For instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from directory history. An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell commands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.

Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:

a       access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette (cd a://).

apt     front end to Debian's APT package management system (cd apt://).

audio   audio CD ripping and playing (cd audio:// or cd device/audio://).

bpp     package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.bpp/bpp://).

deb     package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.deb/deb://).

dpkg    Debian GNU/Linux installed packages (cd deb://).

hp48    view and copy files to/from a HP48 calculator (cd hp48://).

lslR    browsing of lslR listings as found on many FTPs (cd filename/lslR://).

mailfs  mbox-style mailbox files support (cd mailbox/mailfs://).

patchfs extfs to handle unified and context diffs (cd filename/patchfs://).

rpm     RPM package (cd filename/rpm://).

rpms    RPM database management (cd rpms://).

ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha
        archivers (cd archive/xxxx:// where xxxx is one of: ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha).

You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as described in the Edit Extension FileEdit Extension File section. Here is an example entry for Debian packages:

  regex/.deb$
          Open=%cd %p/deb://
[Colors]
Colors

Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal supports color using the terminal database and your terminal name. Sometimes it gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode using the -c and -b flag respectively.

If the program is compiled with the S-Lang screen manager instead of ncurses, it will also check the variable COLORTERM, if it is set, it has the same effect as the -c flag.

You may specify terminals that always force color mode by adding the color_terminals variable to the Colors section of the initialization file. This will prevent Midnight Commander from trying to detect if your terminal supports color. Example:

[Colors]
color_terminals=linux,xterm
color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...

The program can be compiled with both ncurses and S-Lang, ncurses does not provide a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the information in the terminal database.

Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors. Currently the colors are configured using the environment variable MC_COLOR_TABLE or the Colors section in the initialization file.

In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the base_color variable. You can specify an alternate color map for a terminal by using the terminal name as the key in this section. Example:

[Colors]
base_color=
xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red

The format for the color definition is:

  <keyword>=<fgcolor>,<bgcolor>,<attributes>:<keyword>=...

The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, disabled, marked, markselect, errors, input, inputmark, inputunchanged, commandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, inputhistory, commandhistory. Button bar colors are: bbarhotkey, bbarbutton. Status bar color: statusbar. Menu colors are: menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel, menuinactive. Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus, dtitle. Error dialog colors are: errdfocus, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus, errdtitle. Help colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink, helpslink, helptitle. Viewer colors are: viewnormal, viewbold, viewunderline, viewselected. Editor colors are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked, editwhitespace, editlinestate. Popup menu colors are: pmenunormal, pmenusel, pmenutitle.

header determines the color of panel header, the line that contains column titles and sort mode indicator.

input determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.

gauge determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar (gauge), which is used to show the user the progress of file operations, such as copying.

disabled determines the color of the widget that cannot be selected.

The dialog boxes use the following colors: dnormal is used for the normal text, dfocus is the color used for the currently selected component, dhotnormal is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal components, whereas the dhotfocus color is used for the highlighted color in the currently selected component.

Menus use the same scheme but uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel and menuinactive tags instead.

Help uses the following colors: helpnormal is used for normal text, helpitalic is used for text which is emphasized in italic in the manual page, helpbold is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the manual page, helplink is used for not selected hyperlinks and helpslink is used for selected hyperlink.

Popup menu uses following colors: pmenunormal is used for non-selected menu items and as a main color of popup menu window, pmenusel is used for selected menu item, pmenutitle is used for popup menu title.

The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword for transparent background. It is 'default'. The 'default' can only be used for background color. Another special keyword "base" means mc's main colors. When 256 colors are available, they can be specified either as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23. Example:

[Colors]
base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default

Attributes can be any of bold, italic, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if more than one are desired. The special word "none" means no attributes, without attempting to fall back to base_color. Example:

menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline
[Skins]
Skins

You can change the appearance of Midnight Commander. To do this, you must specify a file that contain descriptions of colors and lines to draw boxes. Redefining of the colors is entirely compatible with the assignment of colors, as described in Section ColorsColors.

If your skin contains any true-color definitions, you should define the 'truecolors' key set to TRUE value in [skin] section. If true-color is not used but 256-color is, you should define '256colors' instead.

A skin-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):

        1) command line option -S <skin> or --skin=<skin>
        2) Environment variable MC_SKIN
        3) Parameter skin in section [Midnight-Commander] in config file.
        4) File /gearlock/etc/mc/skins/default.ini
        5) File /gearlock/share/mc/skins/default.ini

Command line option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to the skin-file (with the extension .ini or without it). Search of skin-file will occur in (to the first one found):

        1) ~/.local/share/mc/skins/
        2) /gearlock/etc/mc/skins/
        3) /gearlock/share/mc/skins/

Compatibility

Appointment of color by skin-files fully compatible with the appointment of the colors described in ColorsColors. section.

In this case, reassignment of colors has priority over the skin file and is complementary.[Filenames Highlight]
Filenames Highlight

Section [filehighlight] in current skin-file contains key names as highlight groups and values as color pairs. Color pairs is documented in SkinsSkins section.

Rules of filenames highlight are placed in /gearlock/share/mc/filehighlight.ini file (~/.config/mc/filehighlight.ini). Name of section in this file must be equal to parameters names in [filehighlight] section (in current skin-file).

Keys in these groups are:

type    file type. If present, all other options are ignored.

regexp  regular expression. If present, 'extensions' option is ignored.

extensions
        list of extensions of files. Separated by ';' sign.

extensions_case
        (make sense only with 'extensions' parameter) make 'extensions' rule case sensitive (true) or not (false).

`type' key may have values:
- FILE (all files)
  - FILE_EXE
- DIR (all directories)
  - LINK_DIR
- LINK (all links except stale link)
  - HARDLINK
  - SYMLINK
- STALE_LINK
- DEVICE (all device files)
  - DEVICE_BLOCK
  - DEVICE_CHAR
- SPECIAL (all special files)
  - SPECIAL_SOCKET
  - SPECIAL_FIFO
  - SPECIAL_DOOR

[Special Settings]
Special Settings

Most of Midnight Commander settings can be changed from the menus. However, there are a small number of settings which can only be changed by editing the setup file.

These variables may be set in your ~/.config/mc/ini file:

clear_before_exec
        By default, Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a command. If you would prefer to see the output of the command at the bottom of the screen, edit your ~/.config/mc/ini file and change the value of the field clear_before_exec to 0.

confirm_view_dir
        If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory. If this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for confirmation before changing the directory if you have files tagged.

ftpfs_retry_seconds
        This value is the number of seconds Midnight Commander will wait before attempting to reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the login. If the value is zero, the login will no be retried.

max_dirt_limit
        Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal file viewer. Normally this value is not significant, because the code automatically adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the rate of incoming keystrokes. However, on very slow machines or terminals with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen updates too jumpy.

        It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior, and that is the default value.

mouse_move_pages_viewer
        Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line on the internal file viewer.

only_leading_plus_minus
        Allow special treatment for '+', '-', '*' in the command line (select, unselect, reverse selection) only if the command line is empty. You don't need to quote those characters in the middle of the command line. On the other hand, you cannot use them to change selection when the command line is not empty.

alternate_plus_minus
        If true, use '+', '-', '\' and '*' keys normally. For select/unselect, use 'M-+', 'M--' and 'M-*'.

show_output_starts_shell
        This variable only works if you are not using the subshell support. When you use the C-o keystroke to go back to the user screen, if this one is set, you will get a fresh shell. Otherwise, pressing any key will bring you back to Midnight Commander.

timeformat_recent
        Change the time format used to display dates less than 6 months from now. See strftime or date man page for the format specification. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used.

timeformat_old
        Change the time format used to display dates older than 6 months from now or for dates in the future. See strftime or date man page for the format specification. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used.

torben_fj_mode
        If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly different on the panels, instead of moving the selection to the first and last files in the panels, they will act as follows:

        The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the top line unless it is already on the top line, in this case it will go to the first file in the panel.

        The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the bottom line, in such case it will move the selection to the last file name in the panel.

use_file_to_guess_type
        If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to match the file types listed on the mc.ext fileEdit Extension File.

xtree_mode
        If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system on a Tree panel, it will automatically reload the other panel with the contents of the selected directory.

fish_directory_timeout
        This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The default value is 900 seconds.

clipboard_store
        This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to read text into X selection from file. For example:

clipboard_store=xclip -i

clipboard_paste
        This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to print the selection to standard out. For example:

clipboard_paste=xclip -o

autodetect_codeset
        This option allows use the `enca' command to autodetect codeset of text files in internal viewer and editor. List of valid values can be obtain by the `enca --list languages | cut -d : -f1' command. Option must be located in the [Misc] section.

For example:

autodetect_codeset=russian
[Parameters for external editor or viewer]
Parameters for external editor or viewer

Midnight Commander provides a way for specify an options for external editors and viewers. Midnight Commander tries to search the "[External editor or viewer parameters]" section in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in Midnight Commander's library directory) and then in the ~/.config/mc/ini file. The option name should be equal to the name (full pathname) of external editor or viewer. The option value can contain following variables:

%filename
        The filename to edit/view.

%lineno The start line in the opening file.

For example:

[External editor or viewer parameters]
    vi=%filename +%lineno
    joe=%filename +%lineno
    more=%filename +%lineno

Start line is passed to the external editor/viewer only if it is called from the Find fileFind File results window.

If external editor/viewer is launched via F4/F3 keys, MC hopes that program (at least "joe", but probably others too) has an own feature that by default opens the file where it was last open. MC doesn't prevent external editor/viewer to save and restore position in opened files.[Terminal databases]
Terminal databases

Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal database without requiring root privileges. Midnight Commander searches in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in Midnight Commander's library directory) and in the ~/.config/mc/ini file for the section "terminal:your-terminal-name" and then for the section "terminal:general", each line of the section contains a key symbol that you want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the key. You can use the special \e form to represent the escape character and the ^x to represent the control-x character.

The possible key symbols are:

f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
bs            backspace
home          home key
end           end key
up            up arrow key
down          down arrow key
left          left arrow key
right         right arrow key
pgdn          page down key
pgup          page up key
insert        the insert character
delete        the delete character
complete      to do completion

For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you set this in the ini file:

insert=\e[Op

Also now you can use extended learn keys. For example:
    ctrl-alt-right=\e[[1;6C
    ctrl-alt-left=\e[[1;6D

This means that ctrl+alt+left sends a \e[[1;6D escape sequence and therefore Midnight Commander interprets "\e[[1;6D" as Ctrl-Alt-Left.

The complete key symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke the completion process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you can define other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys everywhere).

[FILES]
FILES

Full paths below may vary between installations. They are also affected by the MC_DATADIR environment variable. If it's set, its value is used instead of /gearlock/share/mc in the paths below.

/gearlock/share/mc/help/mc.hlp

        The help file for the program.

/gearlock/share/mc/mc.ext

        The default system-wide extensions file.

~/.config/mc/mc.ext

/gearlock/share/mc/mc.ini

        System-wide setup files for Midnight Commander, used only if the user doesn't have his own ~/.config/mc/ini file. If /gearlock/etc/mc/mc.ini exists, /gearlock/share/mc/mc.ini isn't used.

/gearlock/share/mc/mc.lib

        Global settings for Midnight Commander. Settings in this file affect all users, whether they have ~/.config/mc/ini or not. Currently, only terminal settingsTerminal databases are loaded from mc.lib.

~/.config/mc/ini

        User's own setup. If this file is present then the setup is loaded from here instead of the system-wide startup file.

/gearlock/share/mc/hints/mc.hint

        This file contains the hints displayed by the program.

/gearlock/share/mc/mc.menu

        This file contains the default system-wide applications menu.

~/.config/mc/menu

        User's own application menu. If this file is present it is used instead of the system-wide applications menu.

~/.cache/mc/Tree

        The directory list for the directory tree and tree view features.

~/.local/share/mc.menu

        Local user-defined menu. If this file is present, it is used instead of the home or system-wide applications menu.

To change default root directory of MC, you can use MC_PROFILE_ROOT environment variable. The value of MC_PROFILE_ROOT must be an absolute path. If MC_PROFILE_ROOT is unset or empty, HOME variable is used. If HOME is unset or empty, MC directories are get from GLib library.[AVAILABILITY]

[License]

                 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>

    Everyone is  permitted  to copy  and  distribute  verbatim copies of this  license  document,  but  changing  it  is  not allowed.

                         Preamble

    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom  to  share  and  change the works. By contrast, the  GNU  General  Public  License  is intended to guarantee your freedom to  share  and  change  all versions of a program to make sure it  remains  free  software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,  use  the GNU General Public  License  for  most  of  our  software;  it applies also to any  other  work  released  this  way  by  its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring  to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses  are  designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them  if  you  wish),  that  you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free  programs, and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these  rights  or  asking  you  to  surrender  the rights. Therefore, you have certain  responsibilities  if  you distribute copies of  the  software,  or  if  you  modify  it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source  code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you  this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuseoccurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
---------------

    “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

    “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

    To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

    A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

    To “propagate” a work means to do anything with  it  that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

    To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

    An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.


1. Source Code.
---------------

    The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

    A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

    The  “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

    The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is
that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
---------------------

    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
--------------------------------------------------------------

    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
-----------------------------

    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
--------------------------------------

    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modificationsto produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to applyto the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
------------------------------

    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
  c) Convey individual copies of the  object code  with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

    A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

    “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
--------------------

    “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
  c) Prohibiting  misrepresentation of the origin of that  material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
---------------

    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your  rights  under  this  License  (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
---------------------------------------------

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
-------------------------------------------------

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets  of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's  predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
------------

    A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

    A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to  copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

    A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
------------------------------------

    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
---------------------------------------------------

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
-------------------------------------

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public  License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

[Warranty]
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
---------------------------

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
----------------------------

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
-----------------------------------------

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
  (at your option) any later version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  GNU General Public License for more details.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
  along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.


    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.


    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
