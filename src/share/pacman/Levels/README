The included level editor (pacmanedit) isn't very difficult to learn to use,
the status bar tells you everything you need to know but here are the keys

UDLR or WSAD:	Move cursor
F:		Fills all blank spaces with pellets
C:		Clears all pellets from board
Q:		Saves and quits
CTRL+C:		Quits WITHOUT saving

Key		Inserts
-----------------------
0 or space:	Blank
1:		Wall
2:		Pellet
3:		Powerup
4:		Ghost/Spawning Wall
5:		Blinky
6:		Inkey
7:		Clyde
8:		Pinky
9:		Pacman


*) The spawning wall is a wall that the ghosts can go through but Pacman
   cannot. These can be used to make levels REALLY difficult. Check level 09

*) Borders shouldn't need to be used, but give it a more Pacman-like feel.
   If a ghost or Pacman are able to reach the very edge of the board, he will
   be teleported to the opposite side of the level, both X and Y just like in
   the regular game.

*) See any included level__.dat file for examples.


To edit a new or existing level, type:
	$ pacmanedit new_or_old_level.dat


To load a custom level, run pacman with the level file as the parameter:
	$ pacman levelfile.dat
